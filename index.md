I am a developmental cognitive neuroscientist, focusing on developing and applying rigorous statistical and machine learning methodologies to better study within- and between-individual variability in brian development due to air pollution and puberty. I am on the job market! Currently, I'm interested in tenure-track Assistant Professor positions in (developmental/computational) neuroscience, public health, or informatics, as well as non-academic positions geared towards either (a) increasing access to scientific tools and knowledge or (b) developing and applying open-source, machine-learning tools for methodologically-robust, data-driven analytics.
